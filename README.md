## Assignment Details
## Project 6: Stack-Based Expression Evaluation

You will convert a C# program that evaluates mathematical expressions using a stack (postfix notation) into MASM assembly code. This project includes implementing stack operations and parsing strings

### Instructions
- Write a C# program that evaluates a postfix expression using a stack.
- Convert the program to MASM, implementing push and pop stack operations and parsing input strings.
- Evaluate the expression and display the result.

### MASM Implementation Notes
- Implement a stack in memory, managing pushes and pops with stack pointer manipulations. - Parse the postfix expression and execute operations based on stack state.

### Running source code
-  The easiest way to run the c# source code is to use the dotnet cli
-  execute `dotnet run` in the directory with the cs file
-  The easiest way to run the asm source code is to setup visual studio 2022 in a windows enviornment (I use a virtual machine since my laptop runs linux)
-  set breakpoints at points of interest and step through the code using the built in debugger in the env.
